# XP Core Values 

## Communication - 
I supported an XP core value throughout the project by contributing to the front-end development of the project. In addition, I took on the responsibility of overseeing all aspects of the team project's activities. This crucial concept aided us in completing the project's requirements within the designated timeframe and allowed us to track our progress at the end of each sprint.

## Simplicity - 
I played a significant role in upholding this XP principle by ensuring that the project's workflow was maintained throughout. Specifically, I was responsible for the program's backend and made sure that transparency, integrity, and dependability were maintained at all times. Drawing on my previous experience with the technological stack, I was able to help the team gain a better understanding of the project's overall concept. In addition, I provided guidance on task prioritization, leveraging my expertise to aid in the project's successful implementation.


## Feedback - 
I played a key role in promoting this XP core concept by providing regular feedback during the sprints. This helped us to generate new ideas and improve our work with each iteration. Additionally, I made a deliberate effort to reduce the time spent on interdependent tasks, leveraging my expertise and understanding to aid in the project's execution.

## Courage - 
I upheld this XP core principle by contributing to the project's front-end development. I value honesty and provided candid feedback to the team, offering practical advice to help us tackle each issue while considering all possible outcomes. I took the initiative to research and become familiar with the latest technologies required to complete the project, which proved useful during the initial setup phase. Additionally, I remained positive and motivated the team even in challenging situations, helping us to overcome obstacles and find solutions.

## Respect - 
We collectively upheld the XP principle of Respect by ensuring that every team member felt appreciated and valued while collaborating. All viewpoints and ideas were given equal respect and consideration, and each team member took the time to listen to one another. We all worked diligently to ensure that the project was of the highest quality and completed without delay. By embracing the other four XP values, we were able to create a culture that fostered respect for one another and ultimately led to our success.

# Why the MERN Stack
React JS is a highly efficient library for abstracting the UI layer, offering developers the flexibility to structure their code in a way that suits their needs. Compared to Angular, React's performance and rendering speed for UIs is superior.

MERN Stack's reliance solely on Javascript enables businesses to save time and money by hiring only Javascript experts, rather than specialists for each technology.

MERN Stack's use of open-source software and hardware provides developers with free access to a wealth of solutions for potential problems that may arise during a project. This functionality streamlines development by eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel.

# Why use MongoDB?

MongoDB provides support for multiple data hierarchies, allowing for greater flexibility in data modeling with the help of secondary indexes. With MongoDB's schemaless nature, there is no need to define the schema in advance. This enables developers to adapt and modify the data model as needed throughout the development process.

# Why NoSQL in a database?
NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases were developed to address the limitations of traditional relational databases in handling large-scale, high-velocity, and unstructured data. Unlike traditional relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases store data in a flexible and scalable format, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
One of the main advantages of NoSQL databases is their ability to handle unstructured and heterogeneous data types, such as social media posts, videos, and sensor data. They can handle large volumes of data, as well as support high-speed, low-latency operations, making them ideal for real-time applications.

# Hosting on Amazon EC2 with Load Balancer

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides scalable computing resources in the cloud. It allows you to create virtual servers in the cloud and run your applications on them. We can host your application on Amazon EC2 with Load Balancer and ensure high availability, scalability, and reliability.
